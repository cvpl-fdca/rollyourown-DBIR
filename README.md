# Roll your own DBIR

This repo is used to give some basic templates and guides for how an organization can begin to create their own internal version of the Verizon DBIR based on their own data.

It has been my dream for a long time to help organizations understand how easy it can be to begin working with their own incident data.

I have had a lot of success starting very simply, which is shown within the template folder. I plan to add more to the guide over time and give more detailed metrics.
